# odin-recipes
<p>This is my first project for The Odin Project. It is a very simple HTML recipe site. I got some good practice with manually setting up the HTML boilerplate and inserting links and images, which feels a bit more intuitive now. I also understand the add/commit process more clearly now; it'll still take some more practice to fully grasp, but at least I understand the fundamentals. It was also good for learning to spot and correct simple coding errors, which I had to do a few times, such as when an image wasn't showing up on the webpage.</p>
